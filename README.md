# GoldMiner_v2: A Maze Solving Rational Agent

### CSC613M (Introduction to Intelligent Systems) MC1

The main objective of the "Gold Miner" project was to implement a maze solving rational agent (Miner) which is able to traverse a maze, navigate through obstacles (Pits), utilize power-ups (Beacons) and locate the end point (Gold).

The intelligent system created should be able to demonstrate three different levels of rational behaviour or intelligence as follows:
<br> ***a. Level 0***: The miner makes random but valid moves and wanders around the grid until it accidentally trips on 'Gold'.
<br> ***b. Level 1***: The rational agent should be able to demonstrate a "strategy" on traversing the maze in order to find the 'Gold' while avoiding falling into 'Pits' randomly scattered in the grid.
<br> ***c. Level 2***: The rational agent should be able to use a search strategy to find the 'best' move given the current configuration using some simple heuristics or memory.
